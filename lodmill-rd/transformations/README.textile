Metadata transformations are done with the software "culturegraph-metafacture":https://github.com/culturegraph. All the necessary mapping and config files for transformations reside in the project's subfolder. The "metafacture-ide-wiki":https://github.com/culturegraph/metafacture-ide/wiki provides documentation for users and developers about how to use these files to tweak or/and execute these transformations.
