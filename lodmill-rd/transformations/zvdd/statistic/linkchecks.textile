The statistic was generated using "this linkchecker":https://github.com/dr0i/tools/blob/master/src/main/java/Linkchecker.java .
Many (some?) links are answered with an "200" status code, but obviously it should be "404" ( see an "example":http://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:gbv:3:1-96420 ) , so you cannot rely solely of this statistic.

The column "links to examples" links to files which provide one example-URL of the domain which answered with the respective status code.
