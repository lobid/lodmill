There are two xml files to be transformed, describing:

1. the e-ressources
2. the collection

1) is described in this drawer
2) is described in the subdirectory "collections"

In the e-ressource file "mapping.textile":http://github.com/lobid/lodmill/blob/master/lodmill-rd/doc/zvdd/mapping.textile resp. the collection file in "mapping.textile":http://github.com/lobid/lodmill/blob/master/lodmill-rd/doc/zvdd/collections/mapping.textile resides a statistic about the frequency of field-keys.
Some keys have only a small amount of different values - these are good candidates 
to use as "controlled vocabulary" (in the LOD context also known as "URIs"). The keys
in question have a corresponding file in the same directory, named after the key.
In these files resides all the possible different values. After a possibly necessary
normalisation, these values be used to map to URIs.
