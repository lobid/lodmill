h1. MAAS

We initially wanted to install Ubuntu on the machines using Ubuntu's Metal-As-A-Service (MAAS) tool. Due to our network setup with an existing DHCP server this turned out to be rather tricky at this point (setting up MAAS with an existing DHCP server seems to be possible in general, but documentation and testing currently focusses on a setup where the MAAS server acts as the DHCP server for the entire network). So in the end, we installed the Ubuntu 12.04 server edition manually on our 4 nodes. We wrote up what we tried to get it running with MAAS in case we or someone else wants to pick up that approach in the future:

* install MAAS server: boot from Ubuntu server CD, follow instructions, see also "https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS":https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS
* @sudo maas createsuperuser@; @sudo maas-import-isos@; @sudo shutdown -r now@
* add nodes via their MAC addresses, see also "https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS/AddNodes":https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS/AddNodes
* all nodes should now be in state _Commissioning_ in the MAAS web config UI
* boot the nodes from an Avahi USB stick, see "https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS/AvahiBoot":https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS/AvahiBoot
* they should boot, do some stuff, and then shut down
* if during booting you see _waiting for network config_ and the node is stuck with a login prompt, delete @/media/maas-rootfs/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules@ on the stick
* all nodes should now be in state _Ready_ in the MAAS web config UI
* setup and bootstrap the juju environment on the MAAS server, see also "https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS/Juju":https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS/Juju:
* @sudo apt-get install juju@; @mkdir ~/.juju@; @touch ~/.juju/environments.yaml@
* write the generated MAAS key to the yaml file:
* e.g. open lynx, go to localhost/MAAS, log in, open preferences,hit @\@, @p@, save as @prefs@
* check how your key starts (e.g. 5x5), then @grep 5x5 prefs > ~/.juju/environments.yaml@
* edit environments.yaml as described on "https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS/Juju":https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS/Juju
* bootstrap juju: @ssh-keygen; juju bootstrap@
* check the MAAS admin UI to see which node is in state _Allocated to ..._
* boot that node from the Avahi stick, MAAS should install the OS on it (takes time)
* now @juju status@ should show information about the nodes (didn't work for us because the MAAS server doesn't act as the DHCP server in our setup)
